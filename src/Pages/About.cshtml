            Welcome to Fishing Radar! The goal of this website is to provide a social media platform focused on anything fishing
            related. Users can feel free to share pictures of fish they caught, where they caught it, cool fishing supply stores, and more.

                Hi, I'm Francis! During the spring and summer, fishing is one of my favorite outdoor activities. I love
                the serenity of the water and meeting fellow fishers. Hope you enjoy the website and share your favorite
                spots to fish and awesome catches!

                Hello, I'm Jason! I love do some leisure activities during my spare time, and going fishing is one of
                them. Thus, it is the reason why I wanted to design this web. with my teammates and allow other fishing
                lovers to share their post, discuss with others, and find new place to go fishing. : )

                Hi, I'm Mark! I'm not really a fan of fishing, but I care about alot about marine environment.
                I think documentating and encouraging people to learn more about marine life will be helpful for
                conservation, that's what motivated me to do this project!
