Project Idea: Fish Radar 

Project Scope 

Our project will be modeled after ContosoCraft website layout, but will not be a e-commerce store. Instead our application will be a fishing social media platform. Our app will allow users to share posts, fishing locations, verify catch rates, and hire guides. All of the functionality will be contained within the following three widgets. 

Widget 1: Sharing & Posting 

The application will have a post feature which will allow users to add pictures/videos of fish they caught and add a short 140 character description to go along with the post.  

Each post can be expanded like Contosocrafts to show the image blown up and scroll in the scenario that the post has multiple images/videos. 

Widget 2: Fishing Locations 

The second widget will be notable fishing locations with detailed descriptions of possible fish that inhabit the area, the number of verified catches of a certain fish (among users), and a weather report for the area.  

Widget 3: Hire a guide 

The third widget will allow users to book trips with experienced fisherman/fishing guide from a database.
